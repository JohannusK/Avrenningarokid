\section{Introduction}
The accurate representation of freshwater runoff is critical for coastal ocean modeling. In archipelagos, a limited number of discrete streams are often introduced to approximate the overall drainage from each island. Using too few streams traps surface water on land, whereas too many complicate numerical ocean models. This work analyzes high-resolution digital surface models to estimate a realistic yet tractable number of runoff paths for each island.
