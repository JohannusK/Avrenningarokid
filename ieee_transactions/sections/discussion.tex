\section{Discussion}
The diminishing returns in coverage imply that a relatively small number of streams can effectively transport most rainfall to the ocean. Selecting a $k$ beyond this point offers little benefit and increases computational expense in ocean models. Future work will integrate temporal rainfall data and validate against observed discharge.
