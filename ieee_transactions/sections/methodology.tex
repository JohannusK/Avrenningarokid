\section{Methodology}
We compute steepest descent paths on a digital surface model to trace potential waterways. The paths are clustered using $k$-means to aggregate neighboring routes into representative streams. By varying $k$, we examine how many clusters capture the majority of rainfall reaching the ocean.
